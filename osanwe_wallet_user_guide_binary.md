## Workflow Example
Hereâ€™s an example workflow for using the wallet:

1. **Create a wallet:**
   ```bash
   dht-wallet create-wallet
   ```

2. **View wallet details:**
   ```bash
   dht-wallet show-wallet
   ```

3. **Send funds to another wallet:**
   ```bash
   dht-wallet send af021a68f707511ad75a980182b10ab7d54bfed3c964073a0ee172f3daa62325 50

   dht-wallet validate
   ```

5. **Synchronize with the network:**
