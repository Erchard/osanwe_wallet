# Osanwe Wallet: A Peer-to-Peer Microtransaction System Without Blockchain

## Abstract
This document proposes a novel decentralized solution for enabling microtransactions without reliance on a blockchain. Inspired by the vision outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, this system prioritizes minimal transaction costs, seamless scalability, and full decentralization. By utilizing Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) and cryptographic signatures, the Osanwe Wallet achieves secure, trustless transactions while preserving the ability to execute micropayments as small as a fraction of a cent.

## Motivation
The original Bitcoin whitepaper introduced the concept of electronic cash that could support trustless, peer-to-peer payments. However, real-world applications of Bitcoin have deviated from this vision due to:
- **High transaction fees**, making micropayments impractical.
- **Blockchain scalability issues**, limiting throughput to a few transactions per second.
- **Centralization risks**, as mining power has concentrated in large pools.

This whitepaper aims to revisit and expand upon Nakamoto’s vision, enabling frictionless micropayments while addressing the limitations of blockchain-based systems.

## Design Goals
1. **Zero Fees**: Eliminate transaction costs, enabling payments as small as a thousandth of a cent.
2. **Full Decentralization**: Ensure all participants operate independently without relying on intermediaries or centralized servers.
3. **Scalability**: Support a global user base while maintaining low latency.
4. **Trustless Mechanism**: Prevent double-spending and ensure honest behavior through cryptographic techniques.

## Proposed Solution
The Osanwe Wallet system combines the efficiency of Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) with cryptographic digital signatures to enable peer-to-peer microtransactions. The design incorporates the following components:

### System Components
1. **Wallet Clients**:
   - Installed by users on their devices (desktop or mobile).
   - Manage private keys, balances, and transaction receipts.
   - Communicate with other clients over a peer-to-peer network.

2. **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)**:
   - A decentralized structure for storing and sharing data among peers.
   - Maintains a global table of the latest transaction receipts, updated periodically (e.g., daily).

3. **Transaction Receipts**:
   - Digital proofs of payment signed by the sender's private key.
   - Include details such as the sender's balance, recipient address, amount transferred, and timestamp.

## Mechanisms
### Transaction Creation
- When a user initiates a payment:
  1. The wallet creates a receipt containing:
     - Sender’s address.
     - Recipient’s address.
     - Amount transferred.
     - Updated sender’s balance.
     - Timestamp.
  2. The receipt is signed using the sender’s private key.
  3. The transaction is broadcast to the DHT network.

### Validation and Synchronization
- Each wallet client validates received transactions by:
  - Verifying the sender’s digital signature.
  - Ensuring the sender’s balance is sufficient.
  - Checking for conflicting transactions using the DHT table.

- The DHT network stores the latest receipts, allowing all clients to verify balances and prevent double-spending.

### Fraud Prevention
- **Double-spending detection**:
  - If conflicting receipts are detected for the same wallet address, the sender’s address is blacklisted.
  - Blacklisted addresses lose access to their funds, discouraging malicious behavior.

### Periodic Cleanup
- The DHT table periodically purges old receipts, keeping only the most recent ones to reduce storage overhead.

## Key Features
1. **Fee-less Transactions**:
   - No miners or validators are required, eliminating transaction fees.

2. **Scalability**:
   - Using a DHT avoids the bottlenecks of blockchain systems.
   - Receipts are distributed among peers, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval.

3. **Decentralization**:
   - Peer-to-peer architecture ensures no single point of failure or control.

4. **Simplicity**:
   - Users only need a wallet client to participate.

## Implementation
### Development Stack
1. **Core Implementation**: Rust
   - Provides high performance and memory safety.
2. **Networking**: libp2p
   - For implementing the DHT and peer-to-peer communication.
3. **Cryptography**: RustCrypto
   - For digital signatures and secure key management.
4. **Mobile Integration**: Flutter (via ffi-support)
   - Ensures compatibility with Android and iOS platforms.

#### Architecture
1. **Wallet Module**:
   - Handles private key generation, balance management, and transaction signing.
2. **DHT Module**:
   - Manages peer discovery, storage, and synchronization of transaction receipts.
3. **Fraud Detection**:
   - Implements rules for detecting and penalizing double-spending attempts.

## Future Work
1. **Enhanced Mobile Support**:
   - Improve user experience with QR codes for address sharing.
2. **Privacy Features**:
   - Implement zero-knowledge proofs to hide transaction details while preserving validation.
3. **Off-Grid Transactions**:
   - Explore Bluetooth or mesh networks for offline payments.

## Conclusion
The Osanwe Wallet presents a novel approach to solving the challenges of micropayments in a decentralized manner. By leveraging distributed hash tables and cryptographic signatures, it eliminates the need for intermediaries and enables fee-less, trustless transactions. With further development and adoption, this system could revolutionize the way small-value payments are conducted globally.
